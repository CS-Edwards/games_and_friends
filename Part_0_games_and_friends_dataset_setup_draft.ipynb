The object is to build mines, cotton factories, ports, canals and rail links, and establish trade routes, all of which will be used to score points. The game is divided into two historical periods: the canal period and the rail period. Victory points are scored at the end of each. Depending on the card the players draw, they will be limited in their choices.\n",

development of the town of Le Havre.  It was inspired by the games Caylus and Agricola and was developed in December 2007.\\nThe game was edited by Uwe Rosenberg and Hanno Girke and the former gets the main cover credit. The illustrator was Klemens Franz while the English translator was Melissa Rogerson. Numerous credits are given to others who assisted with playtesting and other tasks.  The game was published by Lookout Games and distributed by Heidelberger Spieleverlag.\\nThe game was released at Spiel 2008 in both German and Australian English, with both editions published by Lookout Games. It did not do as well as its predecessor Agricola in the Fairplay polls, with a rating of 2.51 (1 is best), but has a high rating of 7.9/10 at BoardGameGeek (a different rating system), ranking among the top 100 games and is generally considered to be highly regarded by critics.\\nThe game was adapted into an iOS app by Codito Development Inc. and released on June 21, 2012. The game has a Metacritic rating of 82% based on 6 critic reviews.\\nA two player version called Le Havre: The Inland Port was released in 2012.  There is also a corresponding iOS app.\\n\\n\\n== Gameplay ==\\nThe gameplay takes place in the harbour of Le Havre, where players take goods such as fish and wood from the wharves. These goods are used either to feed the players' community, to construct buildings and ships, or are processed into finished goods. For example, a smokehouse building may be constructed in which players may process fish into smoked fish, which is more valuable.\\nThe game is played for a set number of rounds. The winner is the player with the greatest net wealth at the end.\\nPoints are earned by making money, building buildings and ships (which each have their own values), and selling goods. At the end of each round, players must be able to give food to their workers. The amount of food depends on the round number and the number of players, starting out low and gradually increasing as the game progresses. Players not planning ahead will soon find themselves with a shortage of food which will require taking loans from the Bank. Building ships can help with this food problem, as each ship will give the player a discount on their food each round (they count as trade routes which give the player more sources of food).\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nLookout Games' Le Havre homepage\\nLe Havre   at BoardGameGeek\",\n          \"Dune is a strategy board game set in Frank Herbert's Dune universe, published by Avalon Hill in 1979. The game was designed by Bill Eberle, Jack Kittredge and Peter Olotka. After many years out of print, the game was reissued by Gale Force Nine in 2019 in advance of the 2021 Dune film adaptation.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe game was originally designed with a Roman Empire theme, with the name Tribute. Avalon Hill had acquired the license to produce a Dune game, but when their design proved unusable, the company contacted Eberle, Kittredge and Olotka. Elements suitable for the Dune universe were added to the game, particularly from their earlier game, Cosmic Encounter.\\nIn 1984, to tie in with the Dune film, Avalon Hill published a second edition of the game as well as two expansions, Spice Harvest and The Duel.\\nThe Spice Harvest expansion changes the initial setup of the standard game by adding a pre-game in which the factions lobby for control of the inter-world Spice market in order to purchase a more advantageous initial position for the start of the main game (control for the planet of Arrakis).\\nThe Duel adds \\\"leader tokens\\\" representing the primary leaders of each faction and a secondary board representing a circular arena for one-on-one combat. Leaders may fight individual combat using a special deck of cards for movement and attacks.\\nBoth supplements included additional Treachery Cards. Both supplements are also incorporated into the French edition published by Jeux Descartes.\\nIn addition, Avalon Hill's strategy magazines, The General and Heroes, published counters and rules for three additional factions: the Bene Tleilax, the Ixians, and the Landsraad, factions and organizations that appeared in Frank Herbert's original novels.\\nThe game received good reviews and due to the popularity of the Dune setting, coupled with the lack of new edition since 1984, became a sought-after item among board game collectors, with prices on secondary market reaching hundreds of dollars. A fan-made print-and-play version was also made available online around 2010.\\nIn the 1990s, Jeux Descartes published a French edition of the game.\\nThe game was reprinted by Fantasy Flight Games in 2012 as Rex: Final Days of an Empire. Fantasy Flight was able to acquire the rights to the system used in Dune (known as the \\u201cSimultaneous Dial Based Order System\\u201d), but were not able to get the license for the Dune setting. As a result, the game's setting was switched to Fantasy Flight's Twilight Imperium universe.\\nWith the demise of Avalon Hill, Dune remained out of print for many years despite being a highly regarded board game. With newfound interest in the Dune series due to the upcoming 2021 Dune film, board game publisher Gale Force 9 reached out to the Herbert estate, which owns the general rights to the game, and received permission to remake it. The art was new for this edition, drawn by Russian illustrator \\\"Ilya77\\\", who was commissioned for the reuse of their art, in addition to the game's original designers, Bill Eberle, Jack Kittredge, and Peter Olotka. Gale Force 9 made very few changes of the game's original rules, tweaking about 3 to 5 percent of the rules. The game was released on October 30, 2019 in advance of the Dune cinematic reboot in late 2021. Along with the reprint, Gale Force Nine also released three expansion sets that allows players to control six additional factions, Ixians, the Tleilaxu, CHOAM, House Richese, House Ecaz, and House Moritani, co-designed by Greg Olotka and Jack Reda.\\n\\n\\n== Gameplay ==\\nPlayers take on the role of one of the factions in the politics of the planet Arrakis. Victory in the game is achieved by controlling a specified number of strongholds, either alone or in an alliance with other players.\\nThe game board, which is based on the book's original map, represents the planet's northern hemisphere. It is divided into radial sections and territories, some of which overlap multiple radial sections. Five territories contain strongholds.\\nThe radial divisions are used exclusively for storm movement. The planet's permanent coriolis storm moves along the radial sections, destroying any troops in its way. It is possible for a multi-radial territory to be partly in storm and partly clear.\\nPlayers move their units from territory to territory. If two or more players enter the same territory, a battle ensues and the contest is resolved using a hidden bidding system based on troop numbers, leaders, and possible treachery cards.\\nSpice serves as money. Each turn, one territory (determined by a card draw) produces a \\\"spice blow\\\", which places an amount of spice in that territory. This is one of the two ways in which all factions can earn spice for auctions, transportation, revival, and negotiating deals. The other is by winning a battle in which a leader is killed, which earns the faction the leader's value in spice.\\nAn auction is held each turn in which players can purchase \\\"treachery cards\\\". These cards contain a variety of uses such as weapons and defenses, which can be used as advantages in resolving battles.\\nEach player has five leader tokens of varying strengths. Leaders are used in combat to supplement the strength of their units. However, each player may have one or more traitors among the other players' leaders, so using leaders can be a risk. Leaders can be killed in combat, but players may use spice to buy dead leaders back from the Bene Tleilaxu tanks.\\n\\n\\n=== Combat ===\\nBattle results when a territory is contested. Combat is resolved using a battle wheel, which consists of three parts: the number of troops, the leader, and any treachery cards which will be used during the battle.\\nEach player in the contest chooses in secret to sacrifice a number of their troops in that territory. Each unit sacrificed gives them a base score of one. Leader tokens add to the strength of their side, provided it survives the attack by the opposing leader. Attacks and defenses affecting leaders are chosen in secret by the players from their available treachery cards.\\nOnce both players have chosen their strategies, they reveal the number of units, leaders and items used. If the player has chosen their opponent's traitor, they are defeated. Otherwise, if a player has used a weapon against which the other player has not used a defense, their opponent's leader is killed. If a laser is used against a shield, all units and leaders are killed from both sides. Otherwise, the scores are then added together, and the player with the lower score is defeated. The player with the higher score, while victorious, still must lose the number of units they planned in their strategy.  In the event of a tie, the attacking player wins the battle.\\n\\n\\n=== Factions ===\\nEach faction has unique powers which modify the rules. Both the default abilities and the optional \\\"Additional Character Advantages\\\" are included below.\\n\\nHouse Atreides\\nDuring auctions, the Atreides player may use \\\"prescience\\\" to view the treachery card being bid on, while other players must bid blind. The Atreides player may also use prescience to look at the next spice blow card, and force their opponents to reveal one element of their battle plan. In advanced rules, the Atreides player may bring the Kwizatz Haderach into play, which adds a bonus to the battle wheel.\\nThe Bene Gesserit\\nThe Bene Gesserit player may temporarily \\\"coexist\\\" with other players' units without causing a confrontation, which allows transportation of one unit to the polar sink free of charge for every other player's transport. The player may command other players to use or not to use certain cards during combat (representing their use of \\\"the Voice\\\"). At the beginning of the game the Bene Gesserit player secretly records the name of another player and the turn at which they think that other player will win the game. If the Bene Gesserit correctly guesses who will win and when, they win the game instead. In advanced rules, Bene Gesserit units are capable of extended coexistence and arrive in the same territory as the other player's transport.\\nThe Padishah Emperor\\nWhen the other players buy treachery cards, they pay the Emperor. The player may revive up to three additional units as gholas. In advanced play, the Emperor has five elite units (Sardaukar) that are twice as effective as ordinary units, although they lose this bonus against the Fremen.\\nThe Fremen\\nThe Fremen armies are already on Arrakis, so they need not pay shipping costs to the Guild. They are also able to use \\\"desert power\\\" to move two territories per turn instead of one. Their troops are not killed if a worm appears; instead, they can ride the worm to a location of their choice. If no-one has won after ten turns and certain strongholds are either unoccupied or occupied by the Fremen, they win. In advanced play, they have three elite units (Fedaykin), and only suffer half losses from the storm.\\nThe Spacing Guild\\nThe Guild player receives the payment when other players transport units onto the board, while paying only half for transporting themselves. They can ship units around the planet, or even send them back to their reserves. If no-one has won after ten turns, and the Fremen don't win, the Guild does. In advanced play, they can choose to take their turn at any point during a turn.\\nHouse Harkonnen\\nWhen the Harkonnen player buys a treachery card, they receive a second one free, without having to show it to the Atreides player. They can hold twice as many treachery cards as other players, to a maximum of eight. Where the other players must choose one traitor out of four, the Harkonnen player can keep all four. In advanced rules, whenever they win a battle, they may kill or temporarily capture a random leader from the loser.\\nEach faction also grants some aspect of their powers to their allies.\\n\\n\\n=== Winning ===\\nA faction wins by controlling three of the five strongholds at the end of a turn. An alliance of factions wins by controlling four of the five strongholds at the end of a turn. In a game with only two factions, the winning faction must control four strongholds.\\nIn a recommended \\\"longer game\\\" variant a faction or alliance of factions must control four strongholds, or all five in a game with only two factions.\\nThree other winning conditions exist:\\nThe Fremen win at the end of turn 10 (the final round of game play) if no faction has won the game by the normal criteria and the occupancy of certain strongholds meets certain constraints. This win condition represents a situation where the Fremen have prevented interference with their own plans for Dune.\\nThe Guild wins if, at the end of turn 10, no faction has won via the conventional win, and the Fremen win conditions are not met. This win condition represents the situation where the Guild has preserved the status quo on Dune and may continue to provide shipping services.\\nThe Bene Gesserit win if, after a faction or alliance has succeeded in a conventional win, they reveal that they predicted (prior to the game's start) that that faction would win in that turn. The Bene Gesserit need only predict one of the winning players in the event of an alliance win. If the Bene Gesserit cause their own alliance to win in the turn that they predicted one of their allies would win, then the Bene Gesserit alone win. This win condition represents the situation where the Bene Gesserit have manipulated the situation so that their hidden agenda is fulfilled.\\nThe Bene Gesserit cannot predict the Fremen or Guild turn 10 default wins.  However they may predict that the Fremen or the Guild will win in turn 10 by the normal majority stronghold occupancy criteria.\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\nIn the January\\u2013February 1980 edition of The Space Gamer (Issue No. 26), Tony Watson commented that \\\"Not only is Dune a good game, it does an amazingly accurate job of conveying the feel and air of Dune the novel.\\\"\\nIn the inaugural edition of Ares Magazine (March 1980), Eric Goldberg gave it a below average rating of 6 out of 9, saying, \\\"Battles are won and lost dependent on the number of spice tokens present in an area. Treachery, storms and the fearsome shai-hulud (gigantic sandworms) enliven affairs. Dune is a nice little game, but nothing special.\\\"\\nIn Issue 77 of the UK magazine Games & Puzzles, Nick Palmer was impressed, writing, \\\"The ability of the game to bring out the delicate power balance in the planetary power struggle depicted by the book is nothing short of extraordinary \\u2014 and yet the rules occupy a mere three pages!\\\" However, Palmer had issues with the alliance rule, which states that players in an alliance can jointly win the game. But Palmer pointed out \\\"A strong alliance can generally win at once, and if one wants to avoid an abrupt ending it seems best to limit wins to single players. One can then employ Diplomacy-like cunning in lining up some unsuspecting allies before making a dash for victory, since allies cannot interfere with each other's plans until alliances are reviewed when the next sandworm appears.\\\"  Nonetheless, Palmer game the game an Excitement rating of 5 out of 5, saying, \\\"Dune is in my view the best game that appeared in 1979, simple, fast-moving, yet packed with strategic and tactical ingenuity.\\\"\\nIn the December 1993 edition of Dragon (Issue 200), Allen Varney considered Dune a classic, saying \\\"Unique flavor comes with the movement rules, combat strategies, and chances that your leaders will turn traitor.\\\" However, Varney advised \\\"Don\\u2019t bother with the unbalanced advanced rules that Avalon Hill foisted on the clean basic design.\\\"\\nIn a retrospective review in There Will Be Games, Jonathan Volk gave high praise to the game's unusual, asymmetrical design. In Dune, he noted, there is no artificial balance, no \\\"Arthurian circularity\\\" to the game table: the various player positions have wildly differing strengths and weaknesses, and the unfairness of the world setup makes \\\"a seductive point of entry\\\". More importantly, that unfairness presses players into complex social relations and moral quandaries rarely found in games. It's \\\"impossibly good, better than any board game I\\u2019ve played, and I\\u2019ve played a lot of them,\\\" wrote Volk, summing up: \\\"No game lingers with me more than Dune.\\nTom Mendelsohn, in a retrospective review from Ars Technica, stated that the game was \\\"moderately popular\\\" during its release, but commented that the 1984 re-release was commercially unsuccessful. Mendelsohn, however, stated that the game was \\\"ahead of its time\\\", shown by the variable number of rounds each game. The reviewer additionally complimented the tenseness, the combat as a \\\"state-of-the-art\\\" mechanic that is a \\\"battle of wits and bluffing\\\", and praised the hidden information and \\\"bursts of chaos\\\". Nevertheless, the asymmetry was criticised as unappealing to some players, Mehdelsohn also stated that the rules are \\\"full of holes and ambiguities\\\" and that the expansions are dubiously necessary. The review also described that Rex: Final Days of an Empire was received less favourably. Similar to Mendelsohn, who commented that Dune \\\"features more than a few rough edges courtesy of how ahead of its time it was\\\", Luke Plunkett from Kotaku observed that the game had \\\"rough edges\\\", criticising that \\\"If a major publisher was pitched Dune in 2020 they\\u2019d likely tear it to pieces, aghast at how so many of this game\\u2019s features are seemingly worthless, overpowered or both at the same time.\\\" Nonetheless, he praised that the \\\"elastic nature\\\" of victory conditions and \\\"treachery lurking\\\", and complimented the engagement in consequence of \\\"unpredictability and unfairness\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Reviews ==\\nCasus Belli #24 (Feb 1985)\\n1982 Games 100 in Games\\n\\n\\n== Expansions ==\\nThe Duel is a 1984 expansion for Dune published by The Avalon Hill Game Company. It provides optional rules for duels between character groups.\\nSteve Crow reviewed The Duel in The Space Gamer No. 76. Crow commented that \\\"In all, The Duel makes an interesting supplement to the original Dune rules, but overuse of the challenge rules just bogs down the game.\\\"\\nThe 2019 Gale Force Nine edition has released three expansions to date, Ixians & Tleilaxu, which adds both of those factions, along with Tech Tokens and additional Treachery Cards, and other new cards, CHOAM & Richese, which adds two more factions, Leader Skill Cards, and Advanced Stronghold Cards, and Ecaz & Moritani, which adds another two factions, homeworld tokens, and new cards.\\nAll three expansions were designed by Eberle, Kittridge, and Olotka, along with Greg Olotka and Jack Reda.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nMendelsohn, Tom (13 May 2017). \\\"Dune: Spice and sandworms power one of the great \\\"lost\\\" board games\\\".

This aligns with the tagline of the game, \\\"YOU are the hero\\\". It can be played individually or with up to four individual players or teams. Players can progress through the game at their preferred pace; it features a save system that allows for the game to be paused and re-started where left off. Each player can save the items they have collected, along with their action deck and terrain card. The game requires players to use a combination of survival skills through the game. These survival skills include hunting, fishing, crafting items, using the current environment of player to advantage, and gaining experience points to trade for new skills. Players go through a different adventure each time the game is played due to the multiple possible random events and alternatives that are possible for any single card. Players can be both easily added and dropped out of a game. The game is designed to be played with cards and dice.\\nThe game exists in a universe where a mysterious land has been discovered off the coast of Antarctica known as the seventh continent. Within this story, each player is an explorer who has just returned from the first expedition to the seventh continent. Several other members of this expedition group have disappeared suddenly upon their return. This explorer has been feeling strange symptoms for the past few days. As the explorer falls asleep at night, they are transported back to the seventh continent where they must lift the curse they are under to resolve the situation. This point is where the board game begins for each player. The goal of the game is help lift the curses that players are fighting through the help of clues. One clue per curse is provided at the start of the game. These clue cards are shuffled into the deck. The game is furthered gradually through the use of Terrain and Event cards. Terrain or adventure cards represent a patch of land or the contents of the seventh continent that a player will explore. They also include information about the events that occur around that terrain. Action cards are played to move about and take various decisions. The action deck contains skills and items that players gain through the game, as well as cards that allow exploration of the continent. These cards also represent a player's health. Players can choose to perform actions individually or in conjunction with other players.\\n\\n\\n== Versions ==\\nThe game is exclusively available through the Serious Poulp website. There is the option of buying a \\\"Classic Edition\\\" base box and a \\\"Collector Edition\\\" base box. The \\\"Collector Edition\\\" base box is exclusively available for those who helped fund the game on Kickstarter. The \\\"Classic Edition\\\" base box retails for $69 USD through the website. Expansion card packets are also available. Additionally, various game accessories are also available for purchase through Serious Poulp. There are also mobile apps available for the game on both the Android and the Apple platforms.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\n2017 Swiss Gamers Award Winner\\n2017 Board Game Quest Awards Best Card Game Winner\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nThe 7th Continent   at BoardGameGeek\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It was inspired by the games Caylus and Agricola and was developed in December 2007.\\nThe game was edited by Uwe Rosenberg and Hanno Girke and the former gets the main cover credit. The illustrator was Klemens Franz while the English translator was Melissa Rogerson. Numerous credits are given to others who assisted with playtesting and other tasks.  The game was published by Lookout Games and distributed by Heidelberger Spieleverlag.\\nThe game was released at Spiel 2008 in both German and Australian English, with both editions published by Lookout Games. It did not do as well as its predecessor Agricola in the Fairplay polls, with a rating of 2.51 (1 is best), but has a high rating of 7.9/10 at BoardGameGeek (a different rating system), ranking among the top 100 games and is generally considered to be highly regarded by critics.\\nThe game was adapted into an iOS app by Codito Development Inc. and released on June 21, 2012. The game has a Metacritic rating of 82% based on 6 critic reviews.\\nA two player version called Le Havre: The Inland Port was released in 2012.  There is also a corresponding iOS app.\\n\\n\\n== Gameplay ==\\nThe gameplay takes place in the harbour of Le Havre, where players take goods such as fish and wood from the wharves. These goods are used either to feed the players' community, to construct buildings and ships, or are processed into finished goods. For example, a smokehouse building may be constructed in which players may process fish into smoked fish, which is more valuable.\\nThe game is played for a set number of rounds. The winner is the player with the greatest net wealth at the end.\\nPoints are earned by making money, building buildings and ships (which each have their own values), and selling goods. At the end of each round, players must be able to give food to their workers. The amount of food depends on the round number and the number of players, starting out low and gradually increasing as the game progresses. Players not planning ahead will soon find themselves with a shortage of food which will require taking loans from the Bank. Building ships can help with this food problem, as each ship will give the player a discount on their food each round (they count as trade routes which give the player more sources of food).\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nLookout Games' Le Havre homepage\\nLe Havre   at BoardGameGeek\",\n          \"Dune is a strategy board game set in Frank Herbert's Dune universe, published by Avalon Hill in 1979. The game was designed by Bill Eberle, Jack Kittredge and Peter Olotka. After many years out of print, the game was reissued by Gale Force Nine in 2019 in advance of the 2021 Dune film adaptation.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe game was originally designed with a Roman Empire theme, with the name Tribute. Avalon Hill had acquired the license to produce a Dune game, but when their design proved unusable, the company contacted Eberle, Kittredge and Olotka. Elements suitable for the Dune universe were added to the game, particularly from their earlier game, Cosmic Encounter.\\nIn 1984, to tie in with the Dune film, Avalon Hill published a second edition of the game as well as two expansions, Spice Harvest and The Duel.\\nThe Spice Harvest expansion changes the initial setup of the standard game by adding a pre-game in which the factions lobby for control of the inter-world Spice market in order to purchase a more advantageous initial position for the start of the main game (control for the planet of Arrakis).\\nThe Duel adds \\\"leader tokens\\\" representing the primary leaders of each faction and a secondary board representing a circular arena for one-on-one combat. Leaders may fight individual combat using a special deck of cards for movement and attacks.\\nBoth supplements included additional Treachery Cards. Both supplements are also incorporated into the French edition published by Jeux Descartes.\\nIn addition, Avalon Hill's strategy magazines, The General and Heroes, published counters and rules for three additional factions: the Bene Tleilax, the Ixians, and the Landsraad, factions and organizations that appeared in Frank Herbert's original novels.\\nThe game received good reviews and due to the popularity of the Dune setting, coupled with the lack of new edition since 1984, became a sought-after item among board game collectors, with prices on secondary market reaching hundreds of dollars. A fan-made print-and-play version was also made available online around 2010.\\nIn the 1990s, Jeux Descartes published a French edition of the game.\\nThe game was reprinted by Fantasy Flight Games in 2012 as Rex: Final Days of an Empire. Fantasy Flight was able to acquire the rights to the system used in Dune (known as the \\u201cSimultaneous Dial Based Order System\\u201d), but were not able to get the license for the Dune setting. As a result, the game's setting was switched to Fantasy Flight's Twilight Imperium universe.\\nWith the demise of Avalon Hill, Dune remained out of print for many years despite being a highly regarded board game. With newfound interest in the Dune series due to the upcoming 2021 Dune film, board game publisher Gale Force 9 reached out to the Herbert estate, which owns the general rights to the game, and received permission to remake it. The art was new for this edition, drawn by Russian illustrator \\\"Ilya77\\\", who was commissioned for the reuse of their art, in addition to the game's original designers, Bill Eberle, Jack Kittredge, and Peter Olotka. Gale Force 9 made very few changes of the game's original rules, tweaking about 3 to 5 percent of the rules. The game was released on October 30, 2019 in advance of the Dune cinematic reboot in late 2021. Along with the reprint, Gale Force Nine also released three expansion sets that allows players to control six additional factions, Ixians, the Tleilaxu, CHOAM, House Richese, House Ecaz, and House Moritani, co-designed by Greg Olotka and Jack Reda.\\n\\n\\n== Gameplay ==\\nPlayers take on the role of one of the factions in the politics of the planet Arrakis. Victory in the game is achieved by controlling a specified number of strongholds, either alone or in an alliance with other players.\\nThe game board, which is based on the book's original map, represents the planet's northern hemisphere. It is divided into radial sections and territories, some of which overlap multiple radial sections. Five territories contain strongholds.\\nThe radial divisions are used exclusively for storm movement. The planet's permanent coriolis storm moves along the radial sections, destroying any troops in its way. It is possible for a multi-radial territory to be partly in storm and partly clear.\\nPlayers move their units from territory to territory. If two or more players enter the same territory, a battle ensues and the contest is resolved using a hidden bidding system based on troop numbers, leaders, and possible treachery cards.\\nSpice serves as money. Each turn, one territory (determined by a card draw) produces a \\\"spice blow\\\", which places an amount of spice in that territory. This is one of the two ways in which all factions can earn spice for auctions, transportation, revival, and negotiating deals. The other is by winning a battle in which a leader is killed, which earns the faction the leader's value in spice.\\nAn auction is held each turn in which players can purchase \\\"treachery cards\\\". These cards contain a variety of uses such as weapons and defenses, which can be used as advantages in resolving battles.\\nEach player has five leader tokens of varying strengths. Leaders are used in combat to supplement the strength of their units. However, each player may have one or more traitors among the other players' leaders, so using leaders can be a risk. Leaders can be killed in combat, but players may use spice to buy dead leaders back from the Bene Tleilaxu tanks.\\n\\n\\n=== Combat ===\\nBattle results when a territory is contested. Combat is resolved using a battle wheel, which consists of three parts: the number of troops, the leader, and any treachery cards which will be used during the battle.\\nEach player in the contest chooses in secret to sacrifice a number of their troops in that territory. Each unit sacrificed gives them a base score of one. Leader tokens add to the strength of their side, provided it survives the attack by the opposing leader. Attacks and defenses affecting leaders are chosen in secret by the players from their available treachery cards.\\nOnce both players have chosen their strategies, they reveal the number of units, leaders and items used. If the player has chosen their opponent's traitor, they are defeated. Otherwise, if a player has used a weapon against which the other player has not used a defense, their opponent's leader is killed. If a laser is used against a shield, all units and leaders are killed from both sides. Otherwise, the scores are then added together, and the player with the lower score is defeated. The player with the higher score, while victorious, still must lose the number of units they planned in their strategy.  In the event of a tie, the attacking player wins the battle.\\n\\n\\n=== Factions ===\\nEach faction has unique powers which modify the rules. Both the default abilities and the optional \\\"Additional Character Advantages\\\" are included below.\\n\\nHouse Atreides\\nDuring auctions, the Atreides player may use \\\"prescience\\\" to view the treachery card being bid on, while other players must bid blind. The Atreides player may also use prescience to look at the next spice blow card, and force their opponents to reveal one element of their battle plan. In advanced rules, the Atreides player may bring the Kwizatz Haderach into play, which adds a bonus to the battle wheel.\\nThe Bene Gesserit\\nThe Bene Gesserit player may temporarily \\\"coexist\\\" with other players' units without causing a confrontation, which allows transportation of one unit to the polar sink free of charge for every other player's transport. The player may command other players to use or not to use certain cards during combat (representing their use of \\\"the Voice\\\"). At the beginning of the game the Bene Gesserit player secretly records the name of another player and the turn at which they think that other player will win the game. If the Bene Gesserit correctly guesses who will win and when, they win the game instead. In advanced rules, Bene Gesserit units are capable of extended coexistence and arrive in the same territory as the other player's transport.\\nThe Padishah Emperor\\nWhen the other players buy treachery cards, they pay the Emperor. The player may revive up to three additional units as gholas. In advanced play, the Emperor has five elite units (Sardaukar) that are twice as effective as ordinary units, although they lose this bonus against the Fremen.\\nThe Fremen\\nThe Fremen armies are already on Arrakis, so they need not pay shipping costs to the Guild. They are also able to use \\\"desert power\\\" to move two territories per turn instead of one. Their troops are not killed if a worm appears; instead, they can ride the worm to a location of their choice. If no-one has won after ten turns and certain strongholds are either unoccupied or occupied by the Fremen, they win. In advanced play, they have three elite units (Fedaykin), and only suffer half losses from the storm.\\nThe Spacing Guild\\nThe Guild player receives the payment when other players transport units onto the board, while paying only half for transporting themselves. They can ship units around the planet, or even send them back to their reserves. If no-one has won after ten turns, and the Fremen don't win, the Guild does. In advanced play, they can choose to take their turn at any point during a turn.\\nHouse Harkonnen\\nWhen the Harkonnen player buys a treachery card, they receive a second one free, without having to show it to the Atreides player. They can hold twice as many treachery cards as other players, to a maximum of eight. Where the other players must choose one traitor out of four, the Harkonnen player can keep all four. In advanced rules, whenever they win a battle, they may kill or temporarily capture a random leader from the loser.\\nEach faction also grants some aspect of their powers to their allies.\\n\\n\\n=== Winning ===\\nA faction wins by controlling three of the five strongholds at the end of a turn. An alliance of factions wins by controlling four of the five strongholds at the end of a turn. In a game with only two factions, the winning faction must control four strongholds.\\nIn a recommended \\\"longer game\\\" variant a faction or alliance of factions must control four strongholds, or all five in a game with only two factions.\\nThree other winning conditions exist:\\nThe Fremen win at the end of turn 10 (the final round of game play) if no faction has won the game by the normal criteria and the occupancy of certain strongholds meets certain constraints. This win condition represents a situation where the Fremen have prevented interference with their own plans for Dune.\\nThe Guild wins if, at the end of turn 10, no faction has won via the conventional win, and the Fremen win conditions are not met. This win condition represents the situation where the Guild has preserved the status quo on Dune and may continue to provide shipping services.\\nThe Bene Gesserit win if, after a faction or alliance has succeeded in a conventional win, they reveal that they predicted (prior to the game's start) that that faction would win in that turn. The Bene Gesserit need only predict one of the winning players in the event of an alliance win. If the Bene Gesserit cause their own alliance to win in the turn that they predicted one of their allies would win, then the Bene Gesserit alone win. This win condition represents the situation where the Bene Gesserit have manipulated the situation so that their hidden agenda is fulfilled.\\nThe Bene Gesserit cannot predict the Fremen or Guild turn 10 default wins.  However they may predict that the Fremen or the Guild will win in turn 10 by the normal majority stronghold occupancy criteria.\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\nIn the January\\u2013February 1980 edition of The Space Gamer (Issue No. 26), Tony Watson commented that \\\"Not only is Dune a good game, it does an amazingly accurate job of conveying the feel and air of Dune the novel.\\\"\\nIn the inaugural edition of Ares Magazine (March 1980), Eric Goldberg gave it a below average rating of 6 out of 9, saying, \\\"Battles are won and lost dependent on the number of spice tokens present in an area. Treachery, storms and the fearsome shai-hulud (gigantic sandworms) enliven affairs. Dune is a nice little game, but nothing special.\\\"\\nIn Issue 77 of the UK magazine Games & Puzzles, Nick Palmer was impressed, writing, \\\"The ability of the game to bring out the delicate power balance in the planetary power struggle depicted by the book is nothing short of extraordinary \\u2014 and yet the rules occupy a mere three pages!\\\" However, Palmer had issues with the alliance rule, which states that players in an alliance can jointly win the game. But Palmer pointed out \\\"A strong alliance can generally win at once, and if one wants to avoid an abrupt ending it seems best to limit wins to single players. One can then employ Diplomacy-like cunning in lining up some unsuspecting allies before making a dash for victory, since allies cannot interfere with each other's plans until alliances are reviewed when the next sandworm appears.\\\"  Nonetheless, Palmer game the game an Excitement rating of 5 out of 5, saying, \\\"Dune is in my view the best game that appeared in 1979, simple, fast-moving, yet packed with strategic and tactical ingenuity.\\\"\\nIn the December 1993 edition of Dragon (Issue 200), Allen Varney considered Dune a classic, saying \\\"Unique flavor comes with the movement rules, combat strategies, and chances that your leaders will turn traitor.\\\" However, Varney advised \\\"Don\\u2019t bother with the unbalanced advanced rules that Avalon Hill foisted on the clean basic design.\\\"\\nIn a retrospective review in There Will Be Games, Jonathan Volk gave high praise to the game's unusual, asymmetrical design. In Dune, he noted, there is no artificial balance, no \\\"Arthurian circularity\\\" to the game table: the various player positions have wildly differing strengths and weaknesses, and the unfairness of the world setup makes \\\"a seductive point of entry\\\". More importantly, that unfairness presses players into complex social relations and moral quandaries rarely found in games. It's \\\"impossibly good, better than any board game I\\u2019ve played, and I\\u2019ve played a lot of them,\\\" wrote Volk, summing up: \\\"No game lingers with me more than Dune.\\nTom Mendelsohn, in a retrospective review from Ars Technica, stated that the game was \\\"moderately popular\\\" during its release, but commented that the 1984 re-release was commercially unsuccessful. Mendelsohn, however, stated that the game was \\\"ahead of its time\\\", shown by the variable number of rounds each game. The reviewer additionally complimented the tenseness, the combat as a \\\"state-of-the-art\\\" mechanic that is a \\\"battle of wits and bluffing\\\", and praised the hidden information and \\\"bursts of chaos\\\". Nevertheless, the asymmetry was criticised as unappealing to some players, Mehdelsohn also stated that the rules are \\\"full of holes and ambiguities\\\" and that the expansions are dubiously necessary. The review also described that Rex: Final Days of an Empire was received less favourably. Similar to Mendelsohn, who commented that Dune \\\"features more than a few rough edges courtesy of how ahead of its time it was\\\", Luke Plunkett from Kotaku observed that the game had \\\"rough edges\\\", criticising that \\\"If a major publisher was pitched Dune in 2020 they\\u2019d likely tear it to pieces, aghast at how so many of this game\\u2019s features are seemingly worthless, overpowered or both at the same time.\\\" Nonetheless, he praised that the \\\"elastic nature\\\" of victory conditions and \\\"treachery lurking\\\", and complimented the engagement in consequence of \\\"unpredictability and unfairness\\\".\\n\\n\\n== Reviews ==\\nCasus Belli #24 (Feb 1985)\\n1982 Games 100 in Games\\n\\n\\n== Expansions ==\\nThe Duel is a 1984 expansion for Dune published by The Avalon Hill Game Company. It provides optional rules for duels between character groups.\\nSteve Crow reviewed The Duel in The Space Gamer No. 76. Crow commented that \\\"In all, The Duel makes an interesting supplement to the original Dune rules, but overuse of the challenge rules just bogs down the game.\\\"\\nThe 2019 Gale Force Nine edition has released three expansions to date, Ixians & Tleilaxu, which adds both of those factions, along with Tech Tokens and additional Treachery Cards, and other new cards, CHOAM & Richese, which adds two more factions, Leader Skill Cards, and Advanced Stronghold Cards, and Ecaz & Moritani, which adds another two factions, homeworld tokens, and new cards.\\nAll three expansions were designed by Eberle, Kittridge, and Olotka, along with Greg Olotka and Jack Reda.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nMendelsohn, Tom (13 May 2017). \\\"Dune: Spice and sandworms power one of the great \\\"lost\\\" board games\\\".

This aligns with the tagline of the game, \\\"YOU are the hero\\\". It can be played individually or with up to four individual players or teams. Players can progress through the game at their preferred pace; it features a save system that allows for the game to be paused and re-started where left off. Each player can save the items they have collected, along with their action deck and terrain card. The game requires players to use a combination of survival skills through the game. These survival skills include hunting, fishing, crafting items, using the current environment of player to advantage, and gaining experience points to trade for new skills. Players go through a different adventure each time the game is played due to the multiple possible random events and alternatives that are possible for any single card. Players can be both easily added and dropped out of a game. The game is designed to be played with cards and dice.\\nThe game exists in a universe where a mysterious land has been discovered off the coast of Antarctica known as the seventh continent. Within this story, each player is an explorer who has just returned from the first expedition to the seventh continent. Several other members of this expedition group have disappeared suddenly upon their return. This explorer has been feeling strange symptoms for the past few days. As the explorer falls asleep at night, they are transported back to the seventh continent where they must lift the curse they are under to resolve the situation. This point is where the board game begins for each player. The goal of the game is help lift the curses that players are fighting through the help of clues. One clue per curse is provided at the start of the game. These clue cards are shuffled into the deck. The game is furthered gradually through the use of Terrain and Event cards. Terrain or adventure cards represent a patch of land or the contents of the seventh continent that a player will explore. They also include information about the events that occur around that terrain. Action cards are played to move about and take various decisions. The action deck contains skills and items that players gain through the game, as well as cards that allow exploration of the continent. These cards also represent a player's health. Players can choose to perform actions individually or in conjunction with other players.\\n\\n\\n== Versions ==\\nThe game is exclusively available through the Serious Poulp website. There is the option of buying a \\\"Classic Edition\\\" base box and a \\\"Collector Edition\\\" base box. The \\\"Collector Edition\\\" base box is exclusively available for those who helped fund the game on Kickstarter. The \\\"Classic Edition\\\" base box retails for $69 USD through the website. Expansion card packets are also available. Additionally, various game accessories are also available for purchase through Serious Poulp. There are also mobile apps available for the game on both the Android and the Apple platforms.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\n2017 Swiss Gamers Award Winner\\n2017 Board Game Quest Awards Best Card Game Winner\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nThe 7th Continent   at BoardGameGeek\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
